# Japanese AI Tutor - New Features Walkthrough

## 🔊 High-Quality Audio (TTS)
We have integrated **Microsoft Edge TTS** to provide natural, native-level Japanese audio.
- **How to use**: 
    1. Start a "Review Session" as usual.
    2. In the Question card, you will see a generic audio player.
    3. Click ▶️ to hear the sentence read aloud by "Nanami" (a natural Japanese female voice).
- **Latency**: Audio is **pre-generated** while the AI prepares your lesson. There is **zero delay** when you click play!

## ⚡ Batch Review System
The "Reset Database" button is gone. Now we use a smart queue system.
- **Start Session**: Click the button to load a batch of 10 due cards.
- **Progress Bar**: Watch the AI prepare your materials (Text + Audio).
- **Smooth Flow**: Once prepared, move through questions instantly without waiting for AI generation between cards.
